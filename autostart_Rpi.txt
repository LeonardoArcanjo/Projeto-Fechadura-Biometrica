How to install Fechadura GUI application desktop boot 

1 - Create a directory 'autostart' in /home/pi/.config if it's not created
before. E.g: mkdir /home/pi/.config/autostart/

2 - Move to this directory and create a name.desktop file with the following
statements:

------------------------------------------------------
[Desktop Entry]

Name=Name Application
Type=Application
Comment=Some Comments about your program
Exec= lxterminal -e {write the all file path}.sh
#Exec=/usr/bin/python3 {write the all file path}.py
------------------------------------------------------

PS: Note that i used the 'python3' that means i used python 3.7. 
You can replace for the 'python' to use python 2.7 

PS1: After some test, it discover that statement "Exec" with "/usr/bin/python3" attribute causes a bug in tela05.py. 
So, it was changed to a new attribute to a file .sh that runs the .py file.

3 - Allow file to be executable

$ sudo chmod +x /home/pi/.config/autostart/name.desktop

4 - Reboot and wait the python GUI run.
